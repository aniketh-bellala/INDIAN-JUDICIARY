This project focuses on the primary activities occurring in the court.
In this digital era, we try to make activities hassle free by
digitalizing them and getting them to your convenience. Keeping the
current scenario of pandemic in mind, it might be beneficial for
respective officials by digitalizing the judiciary system.

India, online with secured access. Results retrieved will be helpful
for a faster and efficient functioning of courts.

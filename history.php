      <p>Supreme Court of India came into existence on 26th January, 1950 and is
        located on Tilak Marg, New Delhi. The Supreme Court of India functioned
        from the Parliament House till it moved to the present building. It has
        a 27.6 metre high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. For a peek
        inside, you'll have to obtain a visitor's pass from the front office. On
        the 28th of January, 1950, two days after India became a Sovereign
        Democratic Republic, the Supreme Court came into being. The inauguration
        took place in the Chamber of Princes in the Parliament building which
        also housed India's Parliament, consisting of the Council of States and
        the House of the People. It was here, in this Chamber of Princes, that
        the Federal Court of India had sat for 12 years between 1937 and 1950.
        This was to be the home of the Supreme Court for years that were to
        follow until the Supreme Court acquired its own present premises. The
        inaugural proceedings were simple but impressive. They began at 9.45
        a.m. when the Judges of the Federal Court - Chief Justice Harilal
        J.Kania and Justices Saiyid Fazl Ali, M. Patanjali Sastri, Mehr Chand
        Mahajan, Bijan Kumar Mukherjea and S.R.Das - took their seats. In
        attendance were the Chief Justices of the High Courts of Allahabad,
        Bombay, Madras, Orissa, Assam, Nagpur, Punjab, Saurashtra, Patiala and
        the East Punjab States Union, Mysore, Hyderabad, Madhya Bharat and
        Travancore-Cochin. Along with the Attorney General for India, M.C.
        Setalvad were present the Advocate Generals of Bombay, Madras, Uttar
        Pradesh, Bihar, East Punjab, Orissa, Mysore, Hyderabad and Madhya
        Bharat. Present too, were Prime Minister, other Ministers, Ambassadors
        and diplomatic representatives of foreign States, a large number of
        Senior and other Advocates of the Court and other distinguished
        visitors. Taking care to ensure that the Rules of the Supreme Court were
        published and the names of all the Advocates and agents of the Federal
        Court were brought on the rolls of the Supreme Court, the inaugural
        proceedings were over and put under part of the record of the Supreme
        Court.</p> </div><br>

        After its inauguration on January 28, 1950, the Supreme Court
        commenced its sittings in a part of the Parliament House. The Court
        moved into the present building in 1958. The building is shaped to
        project the image of scales of justice. The Central Wing of the building
        is the Centre Beam of the Scales. In 1979, two New Wings - the East Wing
        and the West Wing - were added to the complex. In all there are 15 Court
        Rooms in the various wings of the building. The Chief Justice's Court is
        the largest of the Courts located in the Centre of the Central Wing. The
        original Constitution of 1950 envisaged a Supreme Court with a Chief
        Justice and 7 puisne Judges - leaving it to Parliament to increase this
        number. In the early years, all the Judges of the Supreme Court sat
        together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the
        Court increased and arrears of cases began to cumulate, Parliament
        increased the number of Judges from 8 in 1950 to 11 in 1956, 14 in 1960,
        18 in 1978 and 26 in 1986. As the number of the Judges has increased,
        they sit in smaller Benches of two and three - coming together in larger
        Benches of 5 and more only when required to do so or to settle a
        difference of opinion or controversy. The Supreme Court of India
        comprises the Chief Justice and 30 other Judges appointed by the
        President of India. Supreme Court Judges retire upon attaining the age
        of 65 years. In order to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court, a
        person must be a citizen of India and must have been, for atleast five
        years, a Judge of a High Court or of two or more such Courts in
        succession, or an Advocate of a High Court or of two or more such Courts
        in succession for at least 10 years or he must be, in the opinion of the
        President, a distinguished jurist. Provisions exist for the appointment
        of a Judge of a High Court as an Ad-hoc Judge of the Supreme Court and
        for retired Judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts to sit and act as
        Judges of that Court. The Constitution seeks to ensure the independence
        of Supreme Court Judges in various ways. A Judge of the Supreme Court
        cannot be removed from office except by an order of the President passed
        after an address in each House of Parliament supported by a majority of
        the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than
        two-thirds of members present and voting, and presented to the President
        in the same Session for such removal on the ground of proved
        misbehaviour or incapacity. A person who has been a Judge of the Supreme
        Court is debarred from practising in any court of law or before any
        other authority in India. The proceedings of the Supreme Court are
        conducted in English only. Supreme Court Rules, 1966 are framed under
        Article 145 of the Constitution to regulate the practice and procedure
        of the Supreme Court.</p>
